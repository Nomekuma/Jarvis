## Running the Code

To run the code, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `jarvis-main` directory:
```
cd jarvis-main
```

2. Run the following command to execute the code:
```
py JARVIS.py
```
**OR**
```
python JARVIS.py
```

*Note: Consider using a virtual environment*

- To create a virtual environment, use the following command:
```
python -m venv .venv
```

- To activate the virtual environment, use this command:
```
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
```

- To deactivate the virtual environment, use this command:
```
deactivate
```

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, run the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*Note: Make sure to check the path before installing the requirements.*

### If Requirement is Not Found

If you encounter an error stating that the requirement is not found, double-check the path as follows:
```
{Your_path}\Jarvis-jarvis\jarvis-main> 
                              ^
                              |
                [Make sure it is outside the jarvis-main directory]
```

If it is within the jarvis-main path, run the following command to navigate outside:
```
cd ..
```
